#Project Idea

To create a website for freight shipping companies to better manage their day to day business, store analytics, and get a quick, topdown view of operations with a single glance. Fleet should help by automating large, repetitive portions of work, as well as creating paperwork automatically when necessary at certain points throughout the shipping pipeline, and storing relevant data in order to later prefill forms. 


#User Stories :
	
1. As an owner of a small business, I want all of my data in one place to get a better and quicker overview.

2. As a load broker, I want a way to track repeat customers and get my freight moving faster with less paper work and repetition.

3. As a tax preparer, it would make my job easier, if all relevant data was tracked as it happened rather than receiving trash bags of receipts quarterly.

I will add to this as I have better flowing notes.
